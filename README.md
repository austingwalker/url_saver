<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Application Screen Shot](./client/public/assets/images/URL_saver.png)

URL_Saver is a full-stack application created to keep track of URL's. A common occurrence is copy and pasting a URL into the notes section of an iPhone to be saved for later and then never being able to find it again. To prevent this, URL_saver allows the user to create multiple files with different topics and save URL's to them for quick and easy access later.

I wanted to build this application to 1.) Be able to save and find URL's and 2.) Further my expereince using a MySQL database and better understand how relational databases are structured and work.
